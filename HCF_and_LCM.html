          <h2>HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR (HCF)</h2>
          <h5>Semester 1, Term 1, Number and Algebra</h5>
          <p><strong>What is HCF?</strong></p>
          <p>The **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** is the largest number that divides two or more numbers **exactly** without leaving a remainder.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Steps to Find the HCF:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>List all the **factors** of each number.</li>
            <li>Find the **common factors** (numbers that appear in both lists).</li>
            <li>Choose the **largest common factor**—this is the HCF.</li>
          </ol>
  
          <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Find the HCF of 12 and 18.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12</li>
            <li>Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6. The HCF is <strong>6</strong>.</p>
  
          <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Find the HCF of 20 and 30.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20</li>
            <li>Factors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Common factors: 1, 2, 5, 10. The HCF is <strong>10</strong>.</p>
  
          <p><strong>Word Problem:</strong></p>
          <p>Three friends want to share 18 apples, 24 oranges, and 30 bananas equally. What is the largest number of groups they can make?</p>
          <p>Solution: Find the HCF of 18, 24, and 30.  
          - Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18  
          - Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24  
          - Factors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30  
          Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6. The HCF is **6**.  
          So, they can make **6 groups**, each with 3 apples, 4 oranges, and 5 bananas.</p>

        <h2>LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE (LCM)</h2>
        <h5>Semester 1, Term 1, Number and Algebra</h5>
        <p><strong>What is LCM?</strong></p>
        <p>The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by two or more numbers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Steps to Find the LCM:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>List the **multiples** of each number.</li>
            <li>Find the **smallest multiple** that is common to both lists.</li>
            <li>If two numbers overlap in the multiple list, count them only once.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Find the LCM of 4 and 6.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...</li>
            <li>Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common multiples: 12, 24, ... The LCM is <strong>12</strong>.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Find the LCM of 5 and 15.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...</li>
            <li>Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common multiples: 15, 30, ... The LCM is <strong>15</strong>.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Example 3: LCM with Dates:</strong></p>
        <p>Two friends, A and B, attend separate yoga classes. A goes every 4 days, and B goes every 6 days. If both attend class today, when will they next attend on the same day?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...</li>
            <li>Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common multiples: 12, 24, ... The LCM is <strong>12</strong>.</p>
        <p>They will next attend on the same day in <strong>12 days</strong>.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Canceling Overlaps:</strong></p>
        <p>When two numbers have common factors, their multiples can sometimes overlap earlier. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For 4 and 6: 
                - Factors of 4: 2, 2.  
                - Factors of 6: 2, 3.  
                Common factor: 2.  
                Multiples align every 12 because overlapping multiples like 2 × 6 and 4 × 3 reduce to a single cycle.</li>
            <li>If you're finding LCM of 12 and 18:
                - Factors of 12: 2, 2, 3.  
                - Factors of 18: 2, 3, 3.  
                LCM calculation: Take the **maximum powers** of all factors:  
                - 2 (max = 2)  
                - 3 (max = 3 × 3)  
                LCM = \(2^2 × 3^2 = 36\).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p><strong>Word Problem:</strong></p>
        <p>A shop restocks oranges every 15 days and apples every 20 days. If both fruits are restocked today, in how many days will both be restocked together?</p>
        <p>Solution: Find the LCM of 15 and 20.  
        - Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, ...  
        - Multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, ...  
        Common multiples: 60, ... The LCM is **60**.  
        So, both fruits will be restocked together in <strong>60 days</strong>.</p>
